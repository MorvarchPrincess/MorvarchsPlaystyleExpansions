# MorvarchsPlaystyleExpansions
Mod for Pathfinder: WotR, aiming to add new ways to build characters.

Currently adds:

- Bladed brush, use glaives with dex to hit and damage!
- Way of the shooting star, use cha to hit and damage with starknives!
- Hellknight Signifier Fixes, previously signifier was awful for divine casters as domains, channeling and mysteries wouldn't scale and now they do! Word of warning, these havn't been as thoroughly tested (there's a lot) so be a bit careful
- The Hellknight Vanguard, a fear aligned rogue type Hellknight!
